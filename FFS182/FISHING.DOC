  Bluegill                 2 lbs              4 lbs
  Crappie                  3 lbs              6 lbs

                              ]  TOURNAMENT  [

    The weekly tournament is based on a point system.  The number of points
  you receive for a given fish is a percentage of its maximum weight.  An
  example would be an 11 lbs largemouth Bass would be 50 points since its max
  weight is 22 lbs.  If you caught a 22 lbs largemouth Bass it would be 100
  points. 
    This way fish with max weights in the tens and twenties can compete with
  the fish in the forties and fifties.  Especially since 25 lbs Catfish are
  more common than a 22 lbs Bass.
    Depending on when your sysop runs the fishing maintenance the results for
  the week should be decided Saturday morning, meaning a tournament starts
  Saturday and ends Friday.
    Points are given for the best catch on ONE lake at per session. It is not
  accumlitive for a week.  This is so that people that can only play once a
  week can still be in the tournament.



                        ]  Brief Menu Descriptions  [

  Freshwater Fishing Simulator requires ANSI or VT100 terminal emulation
  to run.


    To start a day of fishing, you must first select a lake that you would
  like to fish.  You have two options in choosing a lake.  You can select a
  lake to fish and go straight to the Main Menu, or you can choose to review
  a lake.  When you review a lake, an overhead view of the lake as well as a
  list of the types of fish that inhabit the lake.


                                  ] Main Menu [


  (G)o Fishing : This takes you to the Boat Menu (see below) to go fishing. 
      You can return to this menu from the lake menu at any time.  Scores and
      boat position will remain the same.

  (C)hange Lakes : Change from the lake you're in to another lake.  Your limit
      and number of fish caught will be reset and any records made on the lake
      will be saved before changing lakes. 

  (S)ee Top 15 fish caught : List of Players, size of fish, and lake the fish
      was caught on, in descending order by weight. 

  (D)isplay Map : Gives you an overhead view of the lake you're in, the
      position of your boat on the lake, and the types of fish that inhabit
      the lake. 

  (I)nstructions : View this user documentation.

  (T)oggle Color On/Off : Toggle ANSI color on and off.

  (C)ast Lure : This will bring up the casting menu.  Your boat will appear on
      the left-top of the screen and you'll cast across the screen to the
      right.  You have two speeds of retrieval to choose from, Fast and Slow.
      You stop the retrieve by hitting the space bar.  The speed of
      the lure can be altered anytime during a retrieve.

      When retrieving a lure you can tell when a fish strikes when the word
      'Strike' appears over the lure.  When this happens you have a few
      seconds to hit 'H' to hook the fish.

      After you have hooked the fish, (R)eel'em in will appear at the bottom.
      Be careful when reeling in fish.  Big fish will sometimes start pulling
      the drag (pull line out from the reel).  You'll know this happens when
      'Be careful he is pulling the drag!' appears under the fishing line.
      When this happens, stop reeling by releasing the 'R' key, because he
      could break the line.  If it looks like he is going to go off the screen
      or just get too much line, you can tap the 'R' key and try to hold him a
      little.

      When you successfully bring a fish in, the weight of the fish will be 
displayed.  You can cast again or return to the Boat Menu.



  (P)ick Lure : Takes you to your tackle box to select a lure.  To choose a
      lure select the corresponding number.  A brief description is given for
      each lure below.

                   ----------------------------------------

    Shallow Crankbait : Good in shallow, open water.  Dives to 4' when
                        retrieved slow, 8' when retrieved fast.  Erratic
                        action attracts fish.  Prone to getting snagged when
                        used in heavy cover areas. 

    Deep Crankbait    : Deep open water lure.  Dives to 11' when retrieved
                        slow, 17' when retrieved fast.  Erratic action makes
                        this a good fish attractor, but lure is prone to
                        getting snagged when used in heavy cover.


    Slim Minnow lure  : Good in shallow water.  Dives to 2' when retrieved
                        slow, 4' when retrieved fast.  Good on Cloudy and
                        Partly cloudy days when fish are shallow.

    Top Water Lure    : A lure that floats on top of the water and when
                        retrieved makes wakes and noise that attracts fish.
                        Good on Cloudy and Partly cloudy days when fish are
                        shallow.

    Spinner Bait      : A lure made of wire shaped in a 'V' with a spinner
                        on the top and a leaded hook covered with feathers.
                        This is a very versatile lure.  The flashing spinner
                        is a very good fish attractor.  The lures design
                        makes it almost weedless.  This lure sinks when
                        not moving, stays at the same depth when retrieved
                        slow, and rises in the water when retrieved fast.

    Silver Spoon      : The spoon is flashy lure with an erratic action.
                        Being weedless this lure is great for heavy cover.

    Curly Tailed Jig  : The Jig is good when you let it sink to the bottom
                       and 'jigged' across the bottom.  When let set on the
                       bottom of a lake.  Fish can mistake it for several different types of aquatic life.  Also very good
                       in heavy cover especially around brush and timber.

    Plastic Worm      : The plastic worm is basically a bottom lure being 
                        mistaken for an eel, leech, or just tasty looking.
                        It also does well worked through weeds and other
                        heavy cover.

  (L)ook at Today's Limit : Displays largest 10 fish caught and total number
       and weight of fish caught on this lake today.

  (R)eturn to Main Menu : Returns to main menu.  Limit, number of fish caught,
     and lake position will stay the same if you return.
