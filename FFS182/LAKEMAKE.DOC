  Lake maker will aid in creating and editing LAKEMAP.??? files for the use
in the Freshwater Fishing Simulator. Most of the commands in the program
are pretty self explanitory, so I will just go over them briefly.


  First off this program as does FFS itself will read up to twenty LAKEMAP.???
files in the order they appear in the directory. Tis program must be run in
the same directory that the LAKEMAP.??? files are in.


          !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          PLEASE READ!  PLEASE READ!  PLEASE READ!  PLEASE READ!
          
            After any editing please make sure the corrasponding
          FISHDAT.??? file is deleted too.  The FISHMANT.EXE
          program will lock up if the lake type is changed. The
          program will try to delete it itself but please make sure
          its deleted.

   OK after the title screen is the Lake select screen. Move the Highlight Bar
over the lake you want to edit or Move the bar on to a LAKEMAP.תתת to create
a new lake.

  When editing a lake you will go straight to the edit screen. When makeing
a new lake you'll be asked for the extension for the new lake file. The 
extension can be any three letters or digits you want.

Surface/Submerged view and below that is the depth view.

contians the Surface/Submerged/Depth item you want to change. To select a
Insert Mode Select:

  These will bring up the apropriate menus in thew upper left corner.
When you have choosen an Insert Mode. Use the arrow keys to move to the 
location you want to change. Then hit the corrasponding letter of the item you
want to change.
  You can also use the Repeat Character feature to continuously change
locations as you use the arrow keys to move around the lake. F5 key toggles
this Repeat Mode. When Repeat Mode is first activated it will ask for the
letter of the key you want to repeat within the current Insert Mode. 
  To get out of Repeat Mode just hit F5 agian.
