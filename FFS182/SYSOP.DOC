                        ]  Setting up the program  [


    Freshwater Fishing Simulator requires ANSI or VT\100 terminal emulation
  on the remote end to view.  Locally it is not needed, ANSI screen &
  color codes are handled by the program.
    The ANSI file FISH.ANS that is shown at the beginning of the game, will not
  appear has it should locally. Don't worry, it is being sent out OK. I will
  fix this problem in future versions.


                                PLEASE READ!
    Always run FISHMANT.EXE after setting up the game in any of the following
  manners. FISHMANT.EXE will create the necessary files for the game.




                      ]  Upgrading to this version  [

     If you are running version 0.6 or lower, place all the new files into
  the directory that FFS is in, overwriting the old files.  When the new files
  are in place, run the CONVERT.EXE program.  This program will convert any of
  the old files that need updating and will delete any files that are not
  needed anymore.
    Also included is a program called DOORCFG.EXE.  Run This program if you
  need to re-configure EDOOR.CFG (formally DOOR.CFG).  The contents of
  EDOOR.CFG are explained below.
    Run FISHMANT.EXE to create and update files for the door.

  Then go to the batch file that calls the door and change to the new command
    line format described below.

                           
]  First Time Setup  [


    To set the door up for the first time.  Place all the files into their own
  directory.  To be sure a new game will be set up, delete any files with
  the extension .DAT and delete any FISHDAT.??? files.
     To set up the configuration file for your system, run the program
  DOORCFG.EXE.  DOORCFG.EXE will create the file EDOOR.CFG (explained below),
  which is needed by the door to run.
    After you have set up the configuration file run FISHMANT.EXE to
  initialize the game and create the remaining files needed by the game.




                           ]  Re-initialization  [

    If for some reason you want to re-initialize the game, you can do so by
  deleting all the files with the extension .DAT from the game directory.
    Also at any time the FISHDAT.??? files can be deleted, to restock a lake
  with fish.
                 Caution: Don't delete any LAKEMAP.??? file!

    Then run FISHMANT.EXE to set up a new game.















                         ]  Configuring the door  [


    The configuration file ( EDOOR.CFG ) is a straight text file that
  contains information needed by the program to run.  To edit EDOOR.CFG you
 can use any text editor or DOORCFG.EXE.  The file is set up as followed:




;-------------------  Start of EDOOR.CFG text file  -------------------------
;
;   The semi-colon ; indicates a remark line.
;
;
; First is your BBS name. it can be up to 60 characters long.
Magnetic Storm
;
;
; Second is whether or not you using a multi-node system.
;   Yes or No - The first character in that line must be N or Y.
No
;
;
; Third is if you want Screen Blanking when a user is on from remote.
;   Yes or No - The first character in that line must be N or Y.
No
;
;
; Fourth is the maximum amount of time a user is allowed in the door.
;   number indicates minutes. Time can be between 10 and 9999 minutes.
45
;
;
; Fifth is where the sysop name is put for registration verification.
;   This is not needed for the door to run.
Eric Hamilton

            ]  Explanation of each line in the EDOOR.CFG file  [


      EDOOR.CFG can be edited with the program DOORCFG.EXE that is included
   with v1.0 of the Freshwater Fishing Simulator.



            Any line that begins with a semi-colon ";" is a remark line.


  First  -   Name of your BBS.  This line can contain up to 60 characters of
           text.  This is displayed when exiting from the door, "Returning you
           to the (BBS name)".

  Second -   This tells the door whether or not your using a multi-node
           system.  The first character in the line must be a "Y" or "N" (Yes
           or No).  If the first character is a "Y", then you are running
           Multi-Node. Every time the door is entered a file called
           DOOR_IN.USE is made.  Anyone else trying to enter the door while
           someone is on will be asked to try back later.  If you notice that
           no one is in the door and users receive this message.  Go in and
           delete the file DOOR_IN.USE.

  Third  -   This tells the door whether or not you want the screen blanked
           when a user enters the door.  This is for those that sleep with
           there computers in there room, and don't need a monitor night
           light.  The screen can still be toggled on and off with the F10
           key.

  Fourth -   This allows you to set the maximum amount of time allowed in the
           door.  If you give your users 90 minutes a day but only want them
           in the door for 30 minutes, set this to 30.  The number is in
           minutes and can be set from 10 minutes to 9999 minutes.  If you
           don't care how long a user stays in the door just set this to 9999.

  Fifth  -   This contains the sysops name that the door was registered to.
           This line is not needed for the door to run.

  Sixth  -   This contains the registration code.  This with the registered
           name is used for door registration.  Not needed for the door to
           run.

    Don't use any kind off carrier detection program while fishing door is
  running.  The door will watch the carrier and exit when carrier is dropped.
  If running the program in a multi-node environment, it will be very
  important to let the program handle this itself.  The reason for this is the
  program will create a file called DOOR_IN.USE when multi-node is indicated
  in the config file.  The program will delete DOOR_IN.USE when a player
  exits, so no external programs should be run that will reboot the system in
  case the carrier is dropped.

    If the door keeps telling a user that there is someone else on, and there
  is no one in the game, just go to the directory that FFS is in and delete
  the DOOR_IN.USE file.

                     ***********************************



    Freshwater Fishing will try to detect the presents of a FOSSIL driver.
  If no FOSSIL driver is detected it will default to standard communications
  routines.

    To run the door you must specify the Type of BBS that your using and the
  path to the exit file it creates.

  FISHING  BBSType FilePath  Node#

  BBSType - This will be a number (1 - 5) that tells the program what file to
            look for to get the users information. The choices are as follows.

  BBSType  File Name

     1   DORINFOx.DEF   -   ( QBBS, RBBS )   x will be defined by Node#
     2   DOOR.SYS       -   ( GAP )
     3   CALLINFO.BBS   -   ( Wildcat 2.0 )
     4   SFDOORS.DAT    -   ( Spitfire )
     5   PCBOARD.SYS    -   ( PCBoard 14.x )


    If your BBS software is not listed, check and see if they create any one
  of the files listed.  Some BBS software will create more than just one of
  the following.  If your BBS software doesn't support any of the files
  listed above, send me the file structure and an example of the file I will
  try to include it to any future versions of the door.


  FilePath  -    This will tell the door where to look for the users
               information file, usually the directory the BBS is in.

  Node#     -    This is only used when the BBSType specifies DORINFOx.DEF.
               Node# will be the number of the node.  Node# specified as 0
               would look for the file DORINFO0.DEF.  A 2 in the Node#
               position would tell the door to look for DORINFO2.DEF.  If no
               number is specified Node# defaults to 1.


  Some Examples:

  call fishing with QBBS

  FISHING 1 C:\QBBS
                    ^ since no Node# is specified, it defaults to 1


  call fishing with RBBS from node 2

  FISHING 1 C:\RBBS 2


  call fishing with Wildcat

  FISHING 3 C:\WILDCAT



  LOCKED BAUDS :  For Lock Baud use use the commandline argument /B with 
  the Baud Rate that your modem is locked at.

                          ÚÄÄ No space between the /B and the baud rate
                          v
  FISHING 1 C:\QUICKBBS /B19200  

  configures FFS for QBBS with the baud locked at 19200.



    The door can also be logged on locally with the 
  command line argument /L.

  FISHING /L

    FISHMANT.EXE must be run everyday (probably during your nightly
  maintenance for the BBS).  And is specially important on the weekends. The
  first time maintenance runs on the weekend the winners for the previous 
  weeks tournament are announced. Fish movement and weather is updated and
  player maintenanceis done.

                 ]  FISHTEXT.EXE  -  FFS Bulletin program  [

     Also included with this version is the program FISHTEXT.EXE.  This
  program will create a text file that contains the previous weeks tournament
  winners, the current tournament standings and the top three largest fish in
  each category.
     FISHTEXT.EXE defaults to creating the file FISHTEXT.ASC and FISHTEXT.ANS
  in the current directory.  The name and path can be added to the command 
  line to create a file by name and in a specific path.


  FishText <ASCII Path and FileName> <ANSI Path and FileName>

    Where <ASCII Path and FileName> is the complete Path and Filename
  of the ASCII bulletin you want generated.
  And <ANSI Path and FileName> is the complete Path and Filename of
  the ANSI bulletin you want generated.
    If no Path or Filename is given FishText will write two files called
  FISHTEXT.ASC (ASCII) and FISHTEXT.ANS (ANSI) in the Current Directory


  Example:

  FISHTEXT

  This will create FISHTEXT.ASC and FISHTEXT.ANS in the current directory.

  1.82 - Fixed bug in same fish being caught over agian.
  
  1.81 - Fixed bug that would not recognize if door was registered or not.

  1.8 -  Fix in locking when door exiting. Added Lake Maker to package.


  1.6 -  Better buffer control so data being sent doesn't get behind the
        program. PCBoard 14.x support added. FISHTEXT.EXE now has color
        report.         

  1.5 -  Locked Baud Rate compatibility, Fixed fish "Strike"ing to fast on
       fast machines. FISHMANT updates - Fixed Tournament not updateing on 
       weekends, fixed weather not being updated.
         Big fish pull remote now (now let'em catch a 50lb cat!).

  1.03 - 1.4 *NOT RELEASED*  mostly worked on locked baud compatibility
        and bug fixes explianed  in 1.5 release.

  1.02 -  Recompiled 1.01 because of FISHING.EXE being corrupted.

  1.01 -   Fixed time limit bug. Time limit is know reset in FISHMANT.EXE.
         Some users would not get there time reset.

  1.0 -  More fish (16 different types). Overhead lake view and Tournament.
         Fixed bug that locked up on systems when program exited.

  0.6 -  Hurray! Non-FOSSIL routines that work.

  0.5 -  another attempt at Non FOSSIL routines.

  0.4  -   New configure file. Non FOSSIL routines. Single name bug, where
         people with single names/alias don't get garbage last names. Separate
         Aaintenance program. Door routines improved - sysop functions.

  0.31 -   Retrieve of lure in casting mode increased immensely.
         Bug in lake names on score list fixed.

  0.3 -    Fixed "out of range error" that occurs when scores are adjusted.
         Fish now spread out more logically, no more large schools in one spot.
         Making it easier to find fish.
         Fixed a problem in the reading and converting the users name from
         DORINFO?.DEF file, for door converters that don't change users name
         to all capital letters.
